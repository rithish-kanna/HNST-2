By default the number of iterations is fixed to 15 you can vary them. The next iteration takes the output of the previous iteration as input.

On moving on iterations the sharpened styles applied get merged up.

In merge.py file, you can use any output of background and foreground with applied styles so that the combination that artist wish is used.
